%% Analysis of March 2021 Monkeys

% Notes from Steve
%{ 

A few points:
1) There were 12 animals tested in 2-3 sessions each (sessions on days 0, 4, 7). There were 30 EKG sessions in total across the 12 animals. All
animals got COVID, and 6 were also treated with a type I interferon antagonist that was supposed to worsen the phenotype of the animals. The idea was
to create a model of severe COVID for NIH. All animals were infected between the first and second sessions, I think on day 2 (i.e. 2 days after the
baseline EKG session), but I am not positive. Dr. Levit, can you clarify infection timing?

2) Several of the EKG sessions this time were split into 2 or 3 parts a few minutes apart for some reason. That leads to a few of these having long
segments with no data or just a line between points.

3) Data is organized as a structure within the .MAT file in the EKG variable according to session "j" and EKG lead "k":
EKG(j).categoryName = animal name for session j
EKG(j).categoryNum = artificial number that corresponds to the particular animal for session j
EKG(j).timePoint = a duration variable that shows when session j occurred compared to the first session for that animal
EKG(j).sessionNum = session number for a particular animal (1, 2, or 3) corresponding to the session days (0,4,7)

EKG(j).resample(k) = substructure containing the EKG time and voltage data for lead k
-- Note: The first four sessions (j = 1:4) only collected data for lead II, so there is only k =1 for those sessions.

EKG(j).resample(k).lead = character array indicating the lead for data in (k = 1:7). Leads collected were (I, II, III, aVF, aVR, aVL, Vx).
EKG(j).resample(k).leadNum = number corresponding to the lead, from 1:7
EKG(j).resample(1).time = vector of times, at frequency 300 Hz.
-- Note: Since the time vectors are the same for each lead k within a session j, the time vector is only included in lead k = 1. EKG(j).resample(k =
2:7).time = [] to avoid duplication, since that dramatically reduces the file size. If you would like, I can upload a larger file that duplicates the
time into each lead so you can call along with the voltage.
EKG(j).resample(k).volt = vector of voltages for session j / lead k, indexed the same as the time vector at 300 Hz

4) We will need to get more information from Dr. Levit / Michael for the clinical scores at each time point, and for which animals corresponded to
which group, so we can see if this actually created a more severe phenotype that we can detect with HRV changes.
